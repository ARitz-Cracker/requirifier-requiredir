# requirifier-requiredir

Require a directory

Note: For the sake of easy implementation, this module has no knowladge of the module calling it.
Thus, you must include your own `__dirname` in the directory path (This may be unnecessary in the future)

This module was created to work with [`browser-requirifier`](https://github.com/ARitz-Cracker/browser-requirifier)
